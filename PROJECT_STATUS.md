## 🔑 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Role-Based Permission Architecture (NEW)

```typescript
// Role hierarchy
User (basic access):
  - Dashboard, Locations, AI Visibility, Reviews, Posts, Media, Rankings
  - Voice Search, Alerts, General Settings

Manager (business features):
  - All User features +
  - Premium Listings, Reports, Automations, Onboarding

Admin (full system access):
  - All Manager features +
  - Users, Database Setup, Database Check, Fix Profile

// Permission checking
const hasAccess = (item: NavItem): boolean => {
  if (item.requiredRole) return userRole === item.requiredRole;
  if (item.allowedRoles) return item.allowedRoles.includes(userRole);
  return true; // No restrictions
};

// Developer override system
const effectiveRole = developerRole || getUserRole();
const isDeveloperModeActive = isDeveloperMode && !!developerRole;
```

### Developer Testing Workflow (NEW)

```typescript
// Development environment detection
const devMode = import.meta.env.DEV || window.location.hostname === 'localhost';

// Role persistence
localStorage.setItem('developer-role', role);
const savedRole = localStorage.getItem('developer-role');

// Real-time permission testing
- Switch to Admin → See Users menu appear
- Switch to Manager → See business features, Users disappears
- Switch to User → See only basic features
- "Use Real Role" → Return to actual user permissions
```

### Admin Interface Architecture

```typescript
// User management features
- Search users by name, email, organization
- Filter by status (Active/Suspended)
- Paginated display (20 per page)
- Edit user products and internal notes
- Suspend/activate with reason tracking
- Comprehensive audit log with JSON change tracking

// Mock data structure
- 3 sample users: active customer, suspended customer, manager
- Realistic product assignments and usage patterns
- Complete audit trail for all admin actions
```

### AI Visibility Architecture

```typescript
// Monthly automated reports
- Reports generated on 1st of each month
- 6 months of historical data displayed
- Dropdown selector to view any month's report

// Platform tracking
- ChatGPT (green line)
- Claude (blue line)
- Gemini (orange line)
- Perplexity (purple line)
- Overall combined score (red line, thicker)

// Query system
- 5 auto-generated queries per business
- Up to 5 custom queries (10 total max)
- Queries executed monthly across all platforms

// Competitor detection
- Automatic detection from AI responses
- User can disable false positives
- Tracking across all platforms
```

### Product Access Control Architecture

```typescript
// Organization-level product assignment
const { hasAccess, loading } = useProductAccess({
  organizationId: user.organizationId,
  productName: 'ai_visibility'
});

// Product routes
- GBP Management: /locations, /reviews, /posts, /media, /rankings, /reports, /alerts, /automation
- AI Visibility: /ai-insights
- Voice Search: /voice-search
- Premium Listings: /premium-listings
```

### OAuth Flow Architecture (VERIFIED WORKING)

```
User Authorization (Google) →
Authorization Code (Frontend) →
Netlify Function (Backend) →
Token Exchange (Google APIs) →
Database Storage (Supabase) →
Frontend Status Update →
API Proxy Request →
429 Error (Expected - API Access Pending)
```

## 🐛 DEBUGGING HISTORY & SOLUTIONS

### Session 9 - Sept 29, 2025 (Role-Based Permissions Complete)

**Developer Role Toggle Integration**

- **Challenge:** Floating component positioning and dropdown cutoff issues
- **Solution:** Integrated toggle directly into sidebar below onboarding section
- **Architecture:** Built into Sidebar component with expandable dropdown design
- **Result:** Clean, accessible developer testing interface with no positioning issues

**Permission System Implementation**

- **Challenge:** Complex role-based menu visibility logic
- **Solution:** Implemented both `requiredRole` (exact match) and `allowedRoles` (array match)
- **Permission Structure:**
  - Admin-only: Users, Database Setup, Database Check, Fix Profile
  - Manager/Admin: Premium Listings, Reports, Automations, Onboarding
  - Everyone: Basic management features and general settings
- **Result:** Granular permission control with visual feedback

**Role Prop Passing Issue**

- **Problem:** Role changes not reflecting in sidebar menu items
- **Root Cause:** App.tsx was passing `userRole` instead of `effectiveRole`
- **Solution:** Fixed to pass `userRole={effectiveRole}` to Sidebar component
- **Result:** Real-time role switching working perfectly

**Developer Mode Visual System**

- **Implementation:** Red "DEVELOPER MODE" header with expandable dropdown
- **Role Indicators:** Color-coded avatars (Purple=Admin, Green=Manager, Red=Customer)
- **State Management:** localStorage persistence with clear/reset functionality
- **Result:** Professional developer testing interface integrated into production UI

### Session 8 - Sept 29, 2025 (AI Visibility Complete)

**Achievement: Complete AI Visibility Feature**

- Built entire feature from database to UI in single session
- 8-table database schema with full RLS
- Mock data service with 6 months historical data
- Complete UI matching PDF requirements
- Multi-line trend chart with proper visualization

**Chart Visualization Challenge**

- **Issue:** Initial SVG chart had squished lines on left side
- **Root Cause:** Missing viewBox and incorrect coordinate system
- **Solution:** Added `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` and adjusted stroke widths
- **Result:** Clean, readable multi-line chart spanning full width

**Line Thickness Adjustment**

- **Issue:** Lines too thin to read easily
- **Solution:** Increased stroke widths (Overall: 1.0, Platforms: 0.6)
- **Result:** Clear, distinguishable lines with proper visual hierarchy

### Session 7 - Sept 29, 2025 (Product Access Control)

**TypeScript Errors in products.ts**

- **Problem:** `Cannot find name 'supabase'` errors in type file
- **Root Cause:** Service code duplicated in types file
- **Solution:** Removed service code from `src/types/products.ts`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Clean compilation

**Unused Variable Warning**

- **Problem:** `'scope' is declared but its value is never read`
- **Root Cause:** Unused private class property in googleAuth.ts
- **Solution:** Removed unused `scope` property
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Zero warnings

**Architecture Success:**

- Clean separation: types → service → hooks → UI components
- Product access control system fully functional
- Request access workflow complete

### Session 6 - Sept 28, 2025 (OAuth Integration Success)

**Google OAuth Integration Complete**

- Complete end-to-end OAuth flow working in production
- Tokens being stored and retrieved correctly
- Frontend connection status displaying correctly
- 429 errors prove proxy architecture functional

**Database Table Structure**

- Table structure was correct all along
- Always verify actual issues before modifying working systems

**Local vs Production Testing**

- Test OAuth flows in production where Netlify Functions exist
- Use `netlify dev` for local development with functions

### Known Working Solutions

**Role-Based Permissions:**

- Integrate developer tools into existing UI components ✅
- Use `effectiveRole` for consistent permission checking ✅
- localStorage for developer state persistence ✅
- Both exact role matching and role array support ✅

**AI Visibility Chart:**
