## 🐛 DEBUGGING HISTORY & SOLUTIONS

### Session 8 - Sept 29, 2025 (AI Visibility Complete)

**Achievement: Complete AI Visibility Feature**

- Built entire feature from database to UI in single session
- 8-table database schema with full RLS
- Mock data service with 6 months historical data
- Complete UI matching PDF requirements
- Multi-line trend chart with proper visualization

**Chart Visualization Challenge**

- **Issue:** Initial SVG chart had squished lines on left side
- **Root Cause:** Missing viewBox and incorrect coordinate system
- **Solution:** Added `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` and adjusted stroke widths
- **Result:** Clean, readable multi-line chart spanning full width

**Line Thickness Adjustment**

- **Issue:** Lines too thin to read easily
- **Solution:** Increased stroke widths (Overall: 1.0, Platforms: 0.6)
- **Result:** Clear, distinguishable lines with proper visual hierarchy

### Session 7 - Sept 29, 2025 (Product Access Control)

**TypeScript Errors in products.ts**

- **Problem:** `Cannot find name 'supabase'` errors in type file
- **Root Cause:** Service code duplicated in types file
- **Solution:** Removed service code from `src/types/products.ts`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Clean compilation

**Unused Variable Warning**

- **Problem:** `'scope' is declared but its value is never read`
- **Root Cause:** Unused private class property in googleAuth.ts
- **Solution:** Removed unused `scope` property
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Zero warnings

**Architecture Success:**

- Clean separation: types → service → hooks → UI components
- Product access control system fully functional
- Request access workflow complete

### Session 6 - Sept 28, 2025 (OAuth Integration Success)

**Google OAuth Integration Complete**

- Complete end-to-end OAuth flow working in production

- 429 errors prove proxy architecture functional

**Database Table Structure**

- Table structure was correct all along
- Always verify actual issues before modifying working systems

**Local vs Production Testing**

- Test OAuth flows in production where Netlify Functions exist
- Use `netlify dev` for local development with functions

### Known Working Solutions

**AI Visibility Chart:**

- Use SVG with viewBox for responsive charts ✅
